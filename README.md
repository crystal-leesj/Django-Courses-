# Django-Courses

This is one of assignments from Coding Dojo in python course. The goal of the assignment was building a simple web app using Django. In order to follow the app, you need to create a virtual environment in your virtual environment folder.
> virtualenv djangoEnv

> source djangoEnv/bin/activate

> (djangoEnv)>pip install django

for PC's
> python -m virtualenv djangoEnv

> call djangoEnv/scripts/activate

> (djangoEnv)>pip install django

After you run **python manage.py runserver**, browse yourself to [localhost:8000] (http://localhost:8000).

### Description

With magic of Object Relationship Mapper(ORMs), I've created a simple Django server with a database. This web app can add a course to a table and remove a course from a table.
